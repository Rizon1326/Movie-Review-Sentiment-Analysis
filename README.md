# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
# 📄 Resume Screening and Matching Application
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that enables two functionalities:

- 1.Resume Screening: Automatically categorize resumes into different job profiles using a pre-trained model.
- 2.Resume Matching: Matches uploaded resumes against a provided job description to identify the most suitable candidates based on cosine similarity.

# ⚙️ Features
 ### Resume Screening:
 - Upload resumes in .txt or .pdf format.
 - Automatically predicts the job category based on the content.
 - Provides fun facts or tips related to the predicted category.

 ### Resume Matching::
 - Upload multiple resumes (in .pdf, .docx, or .txt formats).
 - Compare resumes to a job description using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
 - Display the top-matching resumes.

# 💡 Fun Fact
- This app uses cosine similarity to match resumes to a job description. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space, making it perfect for comparing text documents!
